# octave_partitions
a highly inefficient code made when I learned about partitions as a recursive definition two years ago. They use square matrices to compute the number of partitions, the only difference is the recursive rules. Definitely expensive in terms of both time and space, A fun experience to enhance maths knowledge nonetheless :-)
